Yet another attempt at a profile page, this time using Sinatra since it is going to be mostly static

list of things as they come to me (list is overly-picky.. but hey you said be brutal):
Jumbotron text is lighter than it's shadow which makes it hard to read. Darken the font and up the opacity on the shadow.
I'm not a huge fan of the title font... but that's just personal preference.
in "My Story So far" the paralax thing works well.. but the big grey box that comes up right after it hides the effect. Maybe make get rid of the background (behind the main text-box) so we can see the photo.
I wish the background of main body of the Story was a bit lighter as well.
the story might read a little nicer if you made the container a bit narrower
in the Portfolio section, center the text.. or at least the headlines... and I'd darken the font.
Don't need the headline "On the Web" or even "ways to meet me" I'd just have the icons at the top of that section and change "Via Email" to "Contact Me:"
the colors are a bit random (gray up top, blueish in the portfolio, pale yellow in the contacts) I'd stick to one main "theme" color.
I'd speed up the scrolling animation just a tic.. you want your page to appear quick and snappy.
